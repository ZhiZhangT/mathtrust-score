Solve the equations: \( 7x + 2y = 8 \) and \( 3x - y = 3 \), where \( x \) represents acres of corn and \( y \) represents acres of wheat.","Corn=\(\frac{14}{13}\)acres,Wheat=\(\frac{3}{13}\)acres",674dcd9fb00b977d048c9306,Solve the simultaneous equations: \( 7x + 2y = 8 \) and \( 3x - y = 3 \).,,,,0.8535564853556485,0.5069946172820139
